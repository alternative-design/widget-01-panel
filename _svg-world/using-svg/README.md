# Using SVG: Supplementary Material

Code examples and other supplementary material for the book [_Using SVG with CSS3 and HTML5_, by Amelia Bellamy-Royds, Kurt Cagle, and Dudley Storey (O'Reilly Media, 2017)](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920037972.do).

This repository contains:

- All the examples used in the book
- Screenshots of the examples that were used as figures (beware: these are hi-res JPEG and PNG files)
- The SVG code (and screenshots) for other figures which were used to explain concepts
- *(Not finished yet)* Index pages for each chapter connecting the filenames to the figure and example numbers in the book
- *(Not finished yet)* Reference sections for quickly looking up SVG syntax
- *(Not finished yet)* Online extras: sections and tutorials that we couldn't fit in the book, with extra examples and explanation

You can download all the files as a zip using the "Clone or Download" button on the main repository page, or you can click through the file listings to view the code directly in GitHub.

To view the live versions of the code in your web browser, without downloading, start from the [GitHub Pages version of this repository](https://oreillymedia.github.io/Using_SVG/).  For example, you can [play the final version of the gem-collecting game from Chapter 18 here](https://oreillymedia.github.io/Using_SVG/ch18-interaction-files/gem-click-game-misses.svg).

I'll be updating the repo over October & November 2017, as I convert the extra articles and reference guides to HTML and finish the index pages.  If you see any other errors, please file an issue.

These files are covered by [the Oâ€™Reilly Media policy on the use of example code](http://shop.oreilly.com/category/customer-service/faq-examples.do).
